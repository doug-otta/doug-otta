### HEEY THERE! ğŸ‘‹

## ğŸ˜€ aboutMe ğŸ˜€

My name is Douglas Otta, a brazilian cook, maybe in the future a brazilian developer!

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently working as a cook at Grano y Grano, but after I discovered the world of programming, my brain and heart are divided between these two areas. 

ğŸŒ± I've been learning a lot React, Bootstrap and SQL 

ğŸ’¬ And you can find me anywhere using @doug_otta

âš¡ I like a lot the brazilian culinary, specially the brazilian pastry, mixing french techniques and brazilian flavors!
