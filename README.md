  <dt><h2>About Me ğŸ˜€ </h2></dt>
  
  <dd>ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently working as a cook at Grano y Grano, but after I discovered the world of programming, my brain and heart are divided between these two areas.</dd>
  
  <dd>ğŸŒ± I've been learning a lot React, Bootstrap and SQL</dd>
  
  <dd>ğŸ’¬ And you can find me anywhere using @doug_otta </dd>
  
  <dd>âš¡ I like a lot the brazilian culinary, specially the brazilian pastry, mixing french techniques and brazilian flavors!</dd>
